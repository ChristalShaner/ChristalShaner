I am a passionate self-taught programmer, data analyst, and UI/UX designer dedicated to establishing a harmonious balance between nature and technology. In 2021, I was awarded the competitive Rudd Foundation Scholarship, allowing me to further my education at Wichita State University. I am forever grateful to them. My goal is to create impact wherever I may be, whether it be through accessible and interactive webpages, concise data summary reports, or innovative software. Some languages I love working with include HTML5/CSS, JavaScript, React/Material UI, Python3, C++, R, SQL, and SWI-Prolog.
